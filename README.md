SVG to PNG Conversion Tool
==========================
[`svg2png.html`](svg2png.html) is a tiny and bare-bones HTML+JavaScript tool
you can use to convert an [SVG][] (such as one generated by
[`pikchr-cmd`][pikchr-cmd]) to a
[Portable Network Graphics (PNG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/png/) image file using
your web browser’s SVG rasterizer. The conversion is performed entirely in
the client web browser using `Image` and `<canvas>`. You can copy-and-paste
or drag SVG XML into the text box, drag an SVG file from your desktop to the
text box, or enter (or drag) the URL of an image to the box. The natural size
of the rasterization is determined by the web browser and may vary from one
browser to another. You can use the “Oversample” setting to rasterize with
more or less resolution; adjust to the desired sharpness/fidelity. The image
is rasterized into a `<canvas>` and, if possible, a PNG file is extracted as
a `data` URL which is set as the target of the “Save PNG” link. Clicking or
“downloading” the link should save the PNG file locally.

Note that if specifying an image URL from a different origin than the converter
page, the image’s server must enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in order to
[generate a file from the `<canvas>`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#dom-canvas-todataurl).
